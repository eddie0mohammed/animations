1.
i want to be a full stack web developer. i'm a self taught developer and i worker as a front end developer for minimum wage. i want to up my skills and get a better job and get paid more. i know its possible through lambda cause ive read profiles of people who did the same thing.

i have enough savings to last me a couple of years. i'm single and i dont have a lot of expenses. i also live with my parents so i dont have to pay rent. my priority for the next year is to learn as much as i can and then get a job that pays enough for my skills

3.
at the moment i dont work and have no other obligations towards anyone.
i'm ready to commit full time to learning and improving my set of skills.
only way i can miss classes is if i end up in hospital or something. hopefully not

4.
first of all, i highly motivated. i was making minimum wage previously as a front end developer. i want to improve myself and get paid more.
i think im a good return on investment for lambda because i tend to finish the program and get a job that pays at least 100k. and pay lambda back as required.
i think im a good match and its a win win situation.
im highly motivated and i know exactly what i want. 
i want to be a full stack web developer making at least a 100k by next year.
